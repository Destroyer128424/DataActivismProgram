### Activity Steps
1. Review the pros and cons of creating surveys: 
    - Pros: Fast, you get a lot of opinions, confidential, easy to organize, safe (anonymous)
    - Cons: People speed through them, no follow up questions, mostly multiple choice
    - What’s it’s good for: Counts, Statistics, Some open-ended responses
2. Review the general rules of creating survey questions
    - Survey can be finished in under 15 minutes;
    - There are no double-barreled questions;
    - There are no double-negatives;
    - You are clear about the timeframe (e.g., in the last week…);
    - You define words that might be unclear (e.g., “bullying”);
