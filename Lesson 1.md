### Preparation Notes
- For the video and the article, we will complete a 3-2-1 reflection. Make sure to create an online or offline discussion board that allows students to see their classmate’s 3-2-1 responses. Here is an example of an online discussion board, Padlet. Create a free Padlet account or use another tool if you prefer.
- Create Conversation Agreements for your class
    - When talking about identity, there can sometimes be a high degree of vulnerability that students will bring to the conversation. It is important to try as best we can to create a space that supports and celebrates personal vulnerability. To that end, it might be helpful to create some conversation agreements with the class before breaking into groups. These agreements are simple ground rules for how to interact with each other.
    - If you already have a classroom contract, or classroom agreements in your room, it might be sufficient to simply remind students of the classroom contract in this activity. If you do not, here are a few recommended agreements for the conversation:
        - _Care for each other_. It takes a lot to share details about yourself, and we should all care for and support each other in sharing our identities.
        - _Listen to each other_. People feel supported when you show you’re listening, whether that’s by saying you identify with information someone else shared, or repeating back something you heard in someone else’s Daisy that you found interesting.
        - _It’s okay to feel uncomfortable_. If you are feeling uncomfortable about something someone said, or some part of the activity, let your group know or let your teacher know.
