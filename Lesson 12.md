### Activity Steps

1. Choose the specific form of oppression you would like the students to focus on. If you only have a short time with your students, students will probably only have time to conduct one intersectional data visualization, which is most related to the topic that their community organization is focusing on. For instance, if your students are working with a community organization that mitigates food insecurity, start with the intersectional data visualization activity that focuses on food insecurity.
