# Intro to Python Part 2

### Objectives
- Students will learn the basics of Python and will be introduced to Pandas

### Vocabulary
- **Code Library**, n. ​​Bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. It makes programming simpler and convenient for the programmer
- **Pandas**, n. A machine learning library containing tools for data analysis, data manipulation, and cleaning of data
- **List**, n. A data type in programming that represents a finite number of values stored in order. The same value can appear multiple times in a list
- **Boolean**, n. A data type that can have a value of “true” or “false”

### Resources
- How to Debug Code Deepnote
- Student Deepnote Activity Part 2
- Answer Key Deepnote Activity Part 2
- Discussion Video

### Preparation
- Review the Debugging Deepnote and the  answer key before doing this lesson

### Activity Steps
1. Make sure every student completes the pre-survey for lesson 7
2. Before you play the video, Raechel reviews how to debug code using Debugging Deepnote. Instruct students to open the Deepnote before the video starts, so they can follow along with the video
3. Also, show students that they can access the “How to Debug Your Code” Deepnote and the Python Syntax cheat sheet too via Google Classroom before you play the video
4. Make sure students have access to the “Intro to Python Part 2” Activity before the video starts and inform them that they will have to make a duplicate of this notebook.
5. Play the video titled, “Intro to Python Part 2” from the beginning until the end. Here is the script that is used in the video.
    - The first part of the lesson describes how to debug your code 
    - Complete Part 2 of the Intro to Python activity. This is Part 2 of the Deepnote Part 2 Activity. The specific directions for how to complete this activity are in the Deepnote. Here is an overview of what this Deepnote will discuss:
        - Integers
        - Floats
        - Booleans
        - String
        - Conditions and Operators
        - Arithmetic Operators
        - Using multiple variables
        - Lists
        - Pandas
    - Given that this is the second Deepnote activity, consider moving through at least part of the lesson as a group, but try to release students
    - If students need additional support, consider showing them components of the answer key, or providing the answer key at the end of class for students to review and check their own work.
6. Make sure every student completes the post-survey for lesson 7
