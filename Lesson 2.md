### Introduction: 

Intersectionality is recognizing that one’s life is often shaped by different aspects of their identity, such as their race, class, gender,etc. “Employing an Intersectional Framework acknowledges that there are social systems in place that create barriers and challenges for some individuals, while simultaneously providing privilege and power for others. While the idea originated from the scholarship of Black women, an intersectional lens is an important tool in advancing social justice for all groups in today’s society” (Intersectionality in Tech 101) .

We all have our own struggles and challenges, and some of them are small, huge, unfair and beyond our control. It can be challenging to understand someone else’s trials because no one has the same background. You might be a person of color, have a disability or a different religion. I don't know what it's like to be you, and you don't know what it's like to be me. As a result, it is essential to try to understand what other people are going through, so we can help each other overcome those obstacles. Sometimes you will be the person with the most privilege and sometimes you will be the person with the least privilege in a group.

As a result, in this activity we will all work together to make a Pandas Dataframe that combines all of our identities. Next, students will be tasked with getting to know one person in the dataset that seems to have a different background, and will find aspects of their lives that they have in common. The instructions correspond with each slide in the presentation.
