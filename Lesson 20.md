### Activity Steps
1. Students can fill out this <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LtMc4Q1wqpX04iv6OZJiqh566ZOARJ3ruV2WH579Zvw/edit?tab=t.0">worksheet</a> to help them start doing background research on a social justice topic they are passionate about. 
2. Instruct students to search for stories from people in your community where they are discussing their experience with a different form of oppression that they might be experiencing. 
3. Students should answer the following questions in their research: 
    - Underlying Structures: 
        - How has this problem evolved over time? 
        - How is your problem an example of system oppression? 
        - Which forms of oppression will your project analyze?
